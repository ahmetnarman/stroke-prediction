# Predicting Stroke

We all know that genetical and environmental factors have a huge impact on our health and the more we are aware of the effects of these factors on our health, the better we can prevent them. 

This repository includes exploratory analysis and prediction of stroke among patients. The dataset that was used was received from Kaggle, and can be found in the link below:
